1.1 There are six teams in the football league: the Vultures, the Lions, the Eagles, the Beavers, the Tigers, and the Skunks.
 The Vultures have already played the Lions and the Eagles; the Lions have also played the Beavers and Skunks.The Tigers have 
 played the Eagles and Skunks. Each team plays one game per week. Find a schedule so that all teams will have played each 
 other in the fewest number of weeks. Hint. Create a graph whose vertices are the pairs of teams that have not yet played
  each other.What should the edges be so that in a legal coloring of the graph, each color can represent the games played in
   one week?

/*Vultures vs Beavers (V-B)

Vultures vs Tigers (V-T)

Vultures vs Skunks (V-S)

Lions vs Tigers (L-T)

Eagles vs Lions (E-L)

Eagles vs Beavers (E-B)

Eagles vs Skunks (E-S)

Beavers vs Tigers (B-T)

Beavers vs Skunks (B-S)

V-B conflicts with: V-T, V-S, E-B, B-T, B-S (because they share V or B)

V-T conflicts with: V-B, V-S, L-T, B-T (share V or T)

V-S conflicts with: V-B, V-T, E-S, B-S (share V or S)

L-T conflicts with: V-T, E-L, B-T (share L or T)

E-L conflicts with: L-T, E-B, E-S (share E or L)

E-B conflicts with: V-B, E-L, E-S, B-T, B-S (share E or B)

E-S conflicts with: V-S, E-L, E-B, B-S (share E or S)

B-T conflicts with: V-B, V-T, L-T, E-B, B-S (share B or T)

B-S conflicts with: V-B, V-S, E-B, E-S, B-T (share B or S)

Give V-B color 1 (Week 1)

V-T can't be color 1 (conflicts with V-B), so give it color 2 (Week 2)

V-S conflicts with both V-B and V-T, so give it color 3 (Week 3)

L-T conflicts with V-T but not V-B, so it can get color 1 (Week 1)

E-L conflicts with L-T, so it can't be color 1. Give it color 2 (Week 2)

E-B conflicts with V-B and E-L, so it needs color 3 (Week 3)

E-S conflicts with V-S, E-L, and E-B, so it needs color 4 (Week 4)

B-T conflicts with V-B, V-T, L-T, and E-B, so it needs color 4 (Week 4)

B-S conflicts with V-B, V-S, E-B, E-S, and B-T, but it doesn't conflict with V-T or E-L, so it can get color 2 (Week 2)

Week 1 (Color 1):

Vultures vs Beavers

Lions vs Tigers

Week 2 (Color 2):

Vultures vs Tigers

Eagles vs Lions

Beavers vs Skunks

Week 3 (Color 3):

Vultures vs Skunks

Eagles vs Beavers

Week 4 (Color 4):

Eagles vs Skunks

Beavers vs Tigers

Final Answer
We need a minimum of 4 weeks to complete all games!
