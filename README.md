# DSA-in-C++

## Overview
Welcome to the **DSA-in-C++** repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems solved in C++. The goal is to solve **500 DSA problems** with consistent daily commits, ensuring steady progress in mastering DSA.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized in a **Day-wise** manner, where each day's solutions are uploaded based on a structured learning plan.

## Features
- 🧠 **Target of 500 Questions:** Aim to solve and document 500 DSA problems.
- 📅 **Consistent Daily Commits:** Almost daily updates to maintain steady learning.
- ⚡ **Efficient Solutions:** Includes optimized approaches wherever applicable.
- 📄 **Clean and Readable Code:** Well-commented C++ solutions to enhance understanding.
- 🔄 **Continuous Updates:** New problems are added regularly to ensure comprehensive DSA coverage.
- 📚 **Book-Backed Practice:** Also, I’ve started referring to *Data Structures and Algorithms* by **Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman** — just the back questions, because deep-diving into theory would mean actively choosing suffering.
